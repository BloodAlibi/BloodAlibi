# Hi, I'm BloodAlibi.

#### Welcome to my public GitHub profile page!

I am a french game developer. I do not have a specific skill. I do a bit of everything, and that is enough to make games alone. I am the owner and developer of [Tkium](https://www.tkium.com). If you wish to check my projects, it is probably the best place to visit.

For 3 years, I have been a Roblox game developer. I could learn the basics of game development and how to code in LUA. This helped me a lot starting with new engines and other languages, such as C# or Python.

I founded Tkium in 2020. First as a small Roblox group, it became something I can be proud of. By distributing my games on Steam, I could expand its community and make bigger projects.

I wish to learn more and more skills in this activity that I describe as a passion.
